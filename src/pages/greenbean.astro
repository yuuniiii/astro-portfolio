      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Challenge</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        The Green Bean is a student-run coffee lounge on campus with high foot traffic and long lines during
        peak hours. Long lines and only one register make the experience of ordering and waiting for a coffee extremely inefficient.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        Our goal was to design an 
        <span class ="font-black">online ordering platform that allowed students to order
        drinks in advance, see wait times, and reduce congestion at the register
        </span>
         — without
        disrupting the Green Bean’s identity as a community-focused space.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Research & Inspiration</h2>

      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        As a group, we analyzed existing ordering flows from platforms like Starbucks,
        Dunkin’, and Blue Bottle to understand how large systems handle speed,
        customization, and visual clarity.
      </p>

      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        We paid particular attention to:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-neutral-300 space-y-2">
        <li>How featured drinks are surfaced to reduce decision fatigue</li>
        <li>How customization options are revealed progressively</li>
        <li>How users hesitate or abandon the flow</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Process -->
    <div class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Process</h2>

      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        We began with collaborative mapping sessions to define goals, constraints, and
        desired user feelings. Rather than jumping straight into screens, we focused on
        aligning around what the interaction should <em>feel</em> like.
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-neutral-300 space-y-2">
        <li>Mapped the ideal ordering flow from entry to pickup</li>
        <li>Defined emotional goals: quick, simple, efficient, satisfying</li>
        <li>Sketched low-fidelity flows before moving into Figma</li>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Key Design Decisions</h2>

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium">1. Speed Over Novelty</h3>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
          We prioritized efficiency over visual experimentation. The interface is clean,
          predictable, and optimized for repeat use — reflecting the reality that many
          users would order the same drink regularly.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium">2. Featured & Suggested Drinks</h3>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
          Highlighting featured drinks helps first-time users make decisions quickly,
          while encouraging returning users to explore beyond their usual order.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium">3. Progressive Customization</h3>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
          Drink customization options (size, temperature, add-ins) are revealed only when
          relevant, reducing cognitive load and speeding up the main flow.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium">4. Wait-Time Transparency</h3>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
          Showing estimated wait times helps users decide when to order and sets clear
          expectations, reducing frustration at pickup.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- User Testing -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">User Testing & Iteration</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        We conducted informal usability testing with students to evaluate clarity, speed,
        and ease of use. Testing surfaced moments of hesitation around drink customization
        and navigation between categories.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        Based on feedback, we simplified language, reduced the number of visible options at
        once, and clarified call-to-action buttons.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Reflection -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Reflection</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        This project emphasized the importance of aligning interaction design with real
        operational constraints. Working in a group also highlighted how early alignment
        on goals and user experience can make later design decisions more focused and
        defensible.
