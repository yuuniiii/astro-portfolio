    <!-- Context -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Context</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        FlashGrub is a pre-launch 
        <span class ="font-black">mobile app that connects users to local restaurants and markets that have surplus food. </span> 
        It sells pre-made meals and unsold food at a discount, reducing waste and supporting families in
        accessing affordable meals.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        As a Lead Product and Operations Intern, I work closely with the founder to iterate
        on the app experience and prepare it for launch, focusing on helping users understand FlashGrub’s value
        proposition and navigate a product that blends the functionality of traditional marketplace and subscription apps.

    <!-- Challenge -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Challenge</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        As both a subscription service and a pay-as-you-go discount app, FlashGrub is
        concept-dense and difficult to communicate clearly to first-time users, who struggled with:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-neutral-300 space-y-2">
        <li>
          Grasping how the platform worked, what actions users could take,
          and what value they gained
        </li>
        <li>
          Understanding the subscription model and how it balanced affordability
          with long-term sustainability
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        Ultimately, the core challenge was
        <span class ="font-black">making
        a complex idea feel intuitive within just a few screens. </span>
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- HMW -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">How Might We...</h2>
      <ul class="space-y-4 text-neutral-300">
        <li>
          ...communicate a multi-part value proposition efficiently without overwhelming users?
        </li>
        <li>
          ...introduce a subscription model without requiring users to fully
          understand the business mechanics behind it?
        </li>
        <li>
          ...guide users toward meaningful actions while still allowing free exploration?

      </ul>

    <!-- Role -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">My Role</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        I worked independently, owning the end-to-end iteration process while checking in
        weekly with the founder to review findings, challenge assumptions, and align on next steps. My process consists of:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-neutral-300 space-y-2">
        <li>Conducting competitor and market research</li>
        <li>Prototyping and iterating on app features</li>
        <li>Running informal user testing</li>
        <li>Incorporating user feedback into design decisions</li>
        <li>Translating abstract ideas into actionable product choices</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        Prototyping and feedback-driven iteration are the most central parts of my role.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Approach -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Approach: Research, User Testing, Iteration</h2>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-medium">Designing for Users, Not Assumptions</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        A key shift in my process was learning to design based on observed user behavior
        rather than personal intuition.
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-neutral-300 space-y-2">
        <li>Identifying moments of confusion or uncertainty</li>
        <li>Reducing cognitive load in concept-heavy flows</li>
        <li>Emphasizing clarity over feature density</li>
        <li>Iterating incrementally instead of full redesigns</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Stakeholders -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Navigating Feedback & Stakeholder Discussion</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        While working solo, I collaborated closely with the founder through weekly discussions.
        When our perspectives differed, she pushed me to support ideas with concrete user
        testing insights rather than personal preference.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        This feedback loop sharpened my product thinking — decisions were grounded in observed
        behavior, and iteration became more focused and defensible.
      </p>

    <!-- Outcomes -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Qualitative Outcomes</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-neutral-300 space-y-2">
        <li>The app became more informative and easier to understand for first-time users</li>
        <li>User testing showed improved comprehension of FlashGrub’s concept</li>
        <li>The subscription offering was communicated more clearly and confidently</li>
        <li>Abstract ideas were translated into concrete, testable product decisions</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Reflection -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Reflections & Learnings</h2>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-medium">Learning to Direct Without Overwhelming</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        One of the biggest lessons was learning how effective products subtly guide users
        toward next steps without making those paths feel forced.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        This experience fundamentally changed how I evaluate and design digital products.

    <!-- Looking Forward -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Looking Forward</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        With additional time, I would continue refining how the subscription model is introduced,
        focusing on helping users understand its value earlier and more intuitively.
