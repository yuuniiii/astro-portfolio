      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Context</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        Furniture Flow is a mobile app concept designed to help college students in the NYC area
        buy, sell, and move secondhand furniture. The platform combines resale, discovery, and
        optional delivery or short-term storage into a single student-verified marketplace.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        This project was developed as part of a design course. The goal wasn’t to build a full product,
        but to think through how a real marketplace could work end-to-end — from user motivation to
        interface decisions to operational constraints.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Problem -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Problem Space</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        College students frequently resell furniture during move-in, move-out, and housing transitions.
        Through initial research and observation, a few pain points showed up repeatedly:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-neutral-300 space-y-2">
        <li>Listings are scattered across platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and group chats</li>
        <li>Transactions require manual coordination for pickup, transport, and timing</li>
        <li>Trust is inconsistent, especially in dense urban environments</li>
        <li>Delivery and temporary storage are difficult to arrange independently</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        In NYC, these issues are amplified by limited access to cars, small living spaces, and fast housing turnover.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Research -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Research & Inspiration</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        Before designing, I referenced existing marketplace platforms — especially
        <span class="text-neutral-200 font-medium">Facebook Marketplace</span> and
        <span class="text-neutral-200 font-medium">Depop</span> — to study patterns around listing,
        browsing, and trust.
      </p>

      <div class="space-y-3 text-neutral-300">
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          <span class="text-neutral-200 font-medium">Facebook Marketplace</span> highlighted the importance of
          local context and real identities, but also exposed friction around coordination and logistics.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          <span class="text-neutral-200 font-medium">Depop</span> showed how visual-first browsing and lightweight
          categorization can make resale feel engaging and less transactional.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        Rather than copying features directly, I focused on understanding why certain patterns worked — and where they
        broke down for furniture-specific use cases.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Challenge -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Design Challenge</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        The core challenge was balancing <span class="text-neutral-200 font-medium">simplicity</span> with
        <span class="text-neutral-200 font-medium">real-world complexity</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        Furniture resale isn’t just browsing and payment — it involves size, condition, transport, timing, and trust.
        I wanted to acknowledge those constraints without overwhelming users.
      </p>

      <ul class="space-y-4 text-neutral-300">
        <li>How might we make resale feel approachable for busy students?</li>
        <li>How might we introduce logistics (delivery, storage) without making them feel mandatory?</li>
        <li>How might we design trust into the system without heavy-handed verification?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Process -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Process</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        Early drafts were feature-heavy — I tried to solve every problem at once. Through iteration,
        I shifted toward identifying the minimum structure needed to reduce confusion, while deferring complexity
        until it was contextually relevant.
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-neutral-300 space-y-2">
        <li>Mapped the end-to-end journey for buyers and sellers</li>
        <li>Marked “hesitation points” where users would likely feel uncertain</li>
        <li>Simplified flows to reduce cognitive load during listing and browsing</li>
        <li>Iterated incrementally screen-by-screen instead of doing full redesigns</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Decisions -->
    <section class="space-y-10">
      <div class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Key Product & Design Decisions</h2>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
          I approached each major interaction as both a product decision (what matters, what’s optional, what’s risky)
          and a design decision (how to present it clearly and reduce friction).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium">1. Student-Verified Onboarding</h3>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
          The onboarding flow emphasizes <span class="text-neutral-200 font-medium">.edu verification</span> and university affiliation
          (e.g., NYU, Columbia). Product-wise, this narrows the market and establishes trust. Design-wise, it frames the
          app as a campus-specific tool rather than a generic marketplace.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium">2. Guided but Lightweight Listing</h3>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
          Listing uses structured attributes (type, material, wear, price) while keeping the UI photo-forward.
          This is a deliberate tradeoff: structured inputs improve consistency and browsing later, while fewer
          required decisions reduce seller friction.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium">3. Browsing Designed for Exploration</h3>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
          The browse experience prioritizes visual scanning and category-based exploration rather than a search-first workflow.
          Students often browse furniture casually (between classes or while planning moves), so the design supports discovery.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium">4. Contextual Logistics (Not Front-and-Center)</h3>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
          Delivery and storage options are introduced only when relevant (during listing or checkout), rather than positioned as
          the core value proposition. This follows a progressive disclosure approach: advanced features should feel available,
          not required.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Branding -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Branding & Visual Direction</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        I chose a restrained gradient palette and simple typography to balance approachability with credibility.
        The visual system was designed to support clarity and reduce friction, not compete with content.
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-neutral-300 space-y-2">
        <li>Student-friendly, not scrappy</li>
        <li>Trustworthy without feeling corporate</li>
        <li>Clean hierarchy that keeps attention on listings and photos</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Outcome -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Outcome</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        The final prototype communicates a cohesive end-to-end flow:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-neutral-300 space-y-2">
        <li>Verified onboarding</li>
        <li>Clear, structured listing flow</li>
        <li>Visual-first browsing</li>
        <li>Focused item detail views</li>
        <li>Optional logistics support</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        While conceptual, the process emphasized realistic constraints and tradeoffs that a real marketplace product would face.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Reflections -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Reflections</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        This project reinforced the importance of designing systems, not just screens — and using structure as a tool for clarity,
        not control. It shifted my thinking from “what features can we add?” to “what decisions are users being asked to make, and how
        can we make those decisions easier?”
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Next Steps -->
    <section class="space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">If I Had More Time</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-neutral-300 space-y-2">
        <li>Test the listing flow with students to validate which fields feel essential vs. annoying</li>
        <li>Refine how delivery/storage eligibility is communicated (clear, optional, non-salesy)</li>
        <li>Add trust signals on listings (campus proximity, seller history, verification badges)</li>
      </ul>
